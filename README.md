## Overview of the Analysis

This analysis was carried out to create a story to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. In order to do that, we had to create a set of visualizations to:

 - Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
 - Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
 - Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week
 - And Finally, to add other visualizations created in respect to the bike-sharing program to pitch to investors.

## Results

From the story constructed, below are visualizations to be shown to potential investors on information that will be useful for starting the bike-sharing program in Des Moines

## Summary

In General, this [link to dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/profile/onyinye.ekwueme#!/vizhome/citibike_16218099118170/CitibikeStory?publish=yes) shows entirely the stories along side other visualizations to give the investors an understanding to most relevant questions they would have at the back of their minds in considering investing in the bike-sharing program in Des Moines. 

*The overlook of the visualizations shows the low proportion of short-term customers to annual subscribers in the month of August 2019, who are mostly male gender, in which the majority of the bikes are utilized and located in manhattan, within the peak hours on 7am to 8pm with checkout times of 5 - 10 mins.*

To further help in decision making, the dataset can indeed reveal more visualizations like *The start stations for each gender* to show maybe the females or unknown genders are very selective at various stations, and also *Customers by Gender* to indicate the proportion of each gender to customer/subscribers.
